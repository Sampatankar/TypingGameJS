# TypingGameJS
12/20: DOM, Intervals &amp; Events - 20 VanillaJS Projects

This app is a game in which you have to beat the clock by accurately typing random words.

The game has a variable UI based on difficulty setting.  It will generate a random word and place it in the DOM.  Your score will increase after every word is typed, and there is a timer implementation.
Time is added, after a word is typed based on difficulty.  The difficulty is persisted in local storage.

This is the 12th project in Brad Traversy's 20 Web Projects with Vanilla JavaScript course on Udemy.com.

I am working through this project to revise concepts from B.Traversy's Modern JavaScript course, which I completed, and then to practice refactoring code using the React framework
